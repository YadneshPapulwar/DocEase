# DocEase
Document-based Question Answering (QA) is an important service AI is providing across education and productivity. While there are existing applications like Socratic and other QA tools that are question-answering based, they usually focus on the web, have limited document format support, and most often are reliant on a cloud model that raises issues regarding privacy and being offline. We introduce a new application called Docease, which allows the user to upload PDF or DOCX documents and simply ask a natural-language question based on the document. Like other QA systems, Docease uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture that includes document chunking, taking advantage of embeddings and location-based vector storage to get relevant document chunks quickly. A lightweight language model is then used to provide an answer based on the retrieved context. Docease allows for local processing to add a layer of privacy and provides a simple interface that users will find rather easy and intuitive to work within, making it especially useful for students, researchers, and professionals looking for a process to quickly tap into the information contained within documents
